<h1>Sample Mockup</h1>

<p>
  The showoff plugin gives you a simple way to throw arbitrary HTML mockups into your appliction.
  You can use static HTML, ERB, or any other template language (such as HAML) that your 
  application supports.  Just throw your mockups into app/views/mockups, and they will show
  up in the sidebar at <a href="/mockups">/mockups</a>.

<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid duplicating headers, footers, and other layout cruft by using the same layouts that the rest of your app uses.</li>
  <li>By using the same CSS and JS files as the rest of your app, you avoid the pain of merging these things in later.</li>
  <li>Use partials to keep your mockups more maintainable.</li>
  <% 3.times do %>
    <li>Because you have access to Ruby (as opposed to static HTML mockups), you can take advantage of looping to avoid duplication.</li>
  <% end %>
  <li>If you have a library such as Faker installed, you can use it to generate fake data and Lorum Ipsum text, rather than pasting it in</li>
  <li>Easily use your templating language of choice when building mockups (I use HAML).</li>
  <li>Because your mockups can follow the same style and conventions as application code, showoff can drastically reduce the time it takes to wire up a mockup.</li>
</ul>

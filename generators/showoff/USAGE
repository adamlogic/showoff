Description:
  The showoff generator creates the mockups directory along with
  a few samples to demonstrate how to use the plugin. It also
  creates a stylesheet that is used in the sidebar when viewing
  mockups.

Example:
  script/generate showoff

  This will create:
    app/views/mockups (and some samples therein)
    public/stylesheets/showoff.css

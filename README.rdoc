= Showoff

The showoff plugin gives you a simple way to throw arbitrary HTML mockups into your appliction.
You can use static HTML, ERB, or any other templating language (such as HAML) that your 
application supports.  

== Installation

  rails plugin install git://github.com/adamlogic/showoff.git
  rails generate showoff:install

== Dependencies

Yes, this plugin only works with Rails 3.
Rails 2 is still supported in the rails2 branch.

== Usage

Just throw your mockups into app/views/mockups, then navigate to /mockups in your app. Just like any other
Rails view, you can use partials, helpers, etc. If you want to use a layout other than your application
default, nest your mockup in a subdirectory with the same name as the layout (see examples).

== Examples

Once you've run the generator, navigate to /mockups in your app to see some examples.

== Why?

* Avoid duplicating headers, footers, and other layout cruft by using the same layouts that the rest of your app uses.
* By using the same CSS and JS files as the rest of your app, you avoid the pain of merging these things in later.
* Use partials to keep your mockups more maintainable.
* Because you have access to Ruby (as opposed to static HTML mockups), you can take advantage of looping to avoid duplication.
* If you have a library such as Faker installed, you can use it to generate fake data and Lorum Ipsum text, rather than pasting it in.
* Easily use your templating language of choice when building mockups (I use HAML).
* Because your mockups can follow the same style and conventions as application code, showoff can drastically reduce the time it takes to wire up a mockup.
